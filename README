This script monitors the server's external ip address for changes.  When a change is detected, 1and1's dns records for the domain name are updated to point to the new ip address.

TODO:

Connect the two scripts
Clean up 1and1.py and put the config variables in the config file.
Make it so 1and1.py can jump directly to the DNS update page (instead of crawling the links to get there)
